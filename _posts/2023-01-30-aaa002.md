# Advanced Algorithm Analysis
# \#2: Advanced Sums

## Sum to integration

Take a non-decreasing function $f(x)$.

We can estimate lower and upper bound using integration as follows:

$$\int_{0}^{n}f(x)dx \leq \sum_{x=1}^{n}f(x) \leq \int_{1}^{n+1}f(x)dx$$

It comes from the property of the function being non-decreasing.

A little visual proof, consider the green function (non-decreasing when $x \geq 0$).

In this example, $n = 5$.

The green rectangles represent the sum. Their width is 1 and their height is $f(x)$.

It should be possible to see that the sum is smaller that the area under $f(x)$ in the interval $\left \langle 1, n + 1 \right \rangle = \left \langle 1, 6 \right \rangle$,
but larger than the area under $f(x)$ in the interval $\left \langle 0, n \right \rangle = \left \langle 0, 5 \right \rangle$.

Similarly for non-increasing function $f(x)$:

$$\int_{1}^{n+1}f(x)dx \leq \sum_{x=1}^{n}f(x) \leq \int_{0}^{n}f(x)dx$$

*Can you prove it mathematically?*

## Arithmetic sequence

Just a little reminder, arihmetic sequence is a sequence $a_{1}, ... , a_{n}$ such that $a_{i + 1} = a_{i} + d$.

([Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression))

The important takeaway is we can calculate (finite) sum of such sequence using this formula:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}=n\frac{a_{1} + a_{n}}{2}$$

## Geometric sequence

Another little reminder, geometric sequence is a sequence $g_{1}, ... , g_{n}$ such that $g_{i + 1} = q g_{i} $.

([Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series))

The important takeaway is we can calculate (finite) sum of such sequence using this formula:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}g_{i} = \left\{\begin{matrix}
g_{1}\frac{q^{n} - 1}{q - 1} & q \neq 1\\ 
g_{1}n & q = 1 
\end{matrix}\right.$$

and

$$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty }g_{i} = \frac{g_{1}}{1 - q}, \left | q \right | < 1$$
