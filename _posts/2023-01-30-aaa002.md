# \#2: Advanced Sums

## Sum to integration

Take a non-decreasing function $f(x)$.

We can estimate lower and upper bound using integration as follows:

$\int_{0}^{n}f(x)dx \leq \sum_{x=1}^{n}f(x) \leq \int_{1}^{n+1}f(x)dx$

A little visual proof, consider the green function (non-decreasing when $x \geq 0$).

I this example, $n = 5$.

The green rectangles represent the sum. Their width is 1 and their height is $f(x)$.

It should be possible to see that the sum is smaller that the area under $f(x)$ in the interval $\left \langle 1, n + 1 \right \rangle = \left \langle 1, 6 \right \rangle$,
but larger than the area under $f(x)$ in the interval $\left \langle 0, n \right \rangle = \left \langle 0, 5 \right \rangle$.

Similarny for non-increasing function $f(x)$:

$\int_{1}^{n+1}f(x)dx \leq \sum_{x=1}^{n}f(x) \leq \int_{0}^{n}f(x)dx$

## Arithmetic sequence

([Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression))

To sum arithmetic sequences, there is a neat formula

$\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}=n\frac{a_{1} + a_{n}}{2}$$$

## Geometric sequence

// TBD
